# Console-Finances
Javascript practice by analysing finances

## Descritption
This project involved completing a series of tasks to implement and become familiar with javascript. The aim of the project was to complete a fianancial analysis on a given 2d array of data including the month and year in the first column and the revenue in the second column. The tasks included the use of for loops, if statements, indexing a 2d array and using console.log to print outputs to the console. In this particular project, the skill of logic was developed and understood as an important part of coding a problem in javascript. I enjoyed this assignment! 

## The aim of this project was to produce the following in the console:
